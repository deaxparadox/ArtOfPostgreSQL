## What is PostgreSQL

Letâ€™s start with a simple question: what is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an advanced, enterprise-class, and open-source relational database system. PostgreSQL supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying.

PostgreSQL is a highly stable database backed by more than 20 years of development by the open-source community.

PostgreSQL is used as a primary database for many web applications as well as mobile and analytics applications.
