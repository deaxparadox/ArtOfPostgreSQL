# Postgres IN Operator syntax

You use `IN` operator in the `WHERE` clause to check if a value matches any value in a list of values:

The syntax for the `IN` operator is as follows:

```
value IN (value1,value2,...)
```

The `IN` operator returns true if the `value` matches any value in the list i.e., `value1`, `value2`, ...

The list of values can be a list of literal values such as numbers, strings or a result of a `SELECT` statemet like this:

```
value IN (SELECT column_name FROM table_name);
```

The query inside the parentheses is called a `subquery`, which is a query nested inside another query.


### PostgreSQL In operator examples

Suppose you want to known the rental information of customer id 1 and 2, you can use the `IN` operator in the `WHERE` clause as follows:

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
	rental_id,
	return_date
FROM
	rental
WHERE
	customer_id IN (1, 2)
ORDER BY
	return_date DESC;
```

```bash
 customer_id | rental_id |     return_date     
-------------+-----------+---------------------
           2 |     15145 | 2005-08-31 15:51:04
           1 |     15315 | 2005-08-30 01:51:46
           2 |     14743 | 2005-08-29 00:18:56
           1 |     15298 | 2005-08-28 22:49:37
           2 |     14475 | 2005-08-27 08:59:32
           1 |     14825 | 2005-08-27 07:01:57
           2 |     15907 | 2005-08-25 23:23:35
           2 |     12963 | 2005-08-23 11:37:04
           1 |     13176 | 2005-08-23 08:50:54
           1 |     14762 | 2005-08-23 01:30:57
           1 |     12250 | 2005-08-22 23:05:29
           1 |     13068 | 2005-08-20 14:44:16
           2 |     11614 | 2005-08-20 07:04:18
           1 |     11824 | 2005-08-19 10:11:54
           1 |     11299 | 2005-08-10 16:40:52
           1 |     10437 | 2005-08-10 12:12:04

```

The following query uses the equal ( `=` ) and `OR` operators instead of the `IN` operator. It is equivalent to the query above:

```sql
SELECT
	rental_id,
	customer_id,
	return_date
FROM
	rental
WHERE
	customer_id = 1 OR customer_id = 2
ORDER BY
	return_date DESC;
```

The query that uses the `IN` operator is shorter and more readable then the query that uses equal ( `=` ) and `OR` operators.

In addition, PostgreSQL executes the query with the `IN` operator must faster.


### PostgreSQL NOT IN operator

You can combine the `IN` operator with the `NOT` operator to select rows whose values do not match the values in the list.

For example, the following statement finds all rentals with the customer id is not 1 or 2.

```sql
SELECT
	customer_id,
	rental_id,
	return_date
FROM
	rental
WHERE
	customer_id NOT IN (1, 2);
```

```bash
 customer_id | rental_id |     return_date     
-------------+-----------+---------------------
         459 |         2 | 2005-05-28 19:40:33
         408 |         3 | 2005-06-01 22:12:39
         333 |         4 | 2005-06-03 01:43:41
         222 |         5 | 2005-06-02 04:33:21
         549 |         6 | 2005-05-27 01:32:07
         269 |         7 | 2005-05-29 20:34:53
         239 |         8 | 2005-05-27 23:33:46
         126 |         9 | 2005-05-28 00:22:40
         399 |        10 | 2005-05-31 22:44:21
         142 |        11 | 2005-06-02 20:56:02
         261 |        12 | 2005-05-30 05:44:27

```

Similar to the `IN` operator, you an use the not equal ( `<>` ) and `AND` operators to write the `NOT IN` operator:

```sql
SELECT
	customer_id,
	rental_id,
	return_date
FROM
	rental
WHERE
	customer_id <> 1
AND customer_id <> 2;
```

This query returns the same output as above quer that use the `NOT IN` operator.

### PostgreSQL IN with a subquery

The following query returns a list of customer ids from the `rental` table with the return date is `2005-05-27`.

```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM rental
WHERE CAST (return_date AS DATE) = '2005-05-27'
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

```bash
 customer_id 
-------------
          37
          47
          48
          65
          73
          75
          93
         114
         119
         131
         158
         167
         182
         184

```

Because this query returns a list of values, you can use it as the input of the `IN` operator like this:

```sql
SELECT
	customer_id,
	first_name,
	last_name
FROM
	customer
WHERE
	customer_id IN (
		SELECT customer_id
		FROM rental
		WHERE CAST (return_date AS DATE) = '2005-05-27'
	)
ORDER BY customer_id;
```


```bash
 customer_id | first_name |  last_name  
-------------+------------+-------------
          37 | Pamela     | Baker
          47 | Frances    | Parker
          48 | Ann        | Evans
          65 | Rose       | Howard
          73 | Beverly    | Brooks
          75 | Tammy      | Sanders
          93 | Phyllis    | Foster
         114 | Grace      | Ellis
         119 | Sherry     | Marshall

```
