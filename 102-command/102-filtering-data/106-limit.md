# Introduction to PostgreSQL LIMIT clause

PostgreSQL `LIMIT` is an optional clause of the `SELECT` statement that constrains the number of rows returned by the query.

The following illustrates the syntax of the `LIMIT` clause:

```sql
SELECT select_list 
FROM table_name
ORDER BY sort_expression
LIMIT row_count
```

The statement returns `row_count` rows generated by the query. If `row_count` is zero, the query returns an empty set. In case `row_count` is `NULL`, the query returns the same result as it does not have the `LIMIT` clause.

In case you want to skip a number of rows before returning the `row_count` rows, you use `OFFSET` clause placed after the `LIMIT` clause as the following statement:

```sql
SELECT select_list
FROM table_name
LIMIT row_count OFFSET row_to_skip;
```

The statement first skips `row_to_skip` rows before returning `row_count` rows generated by the query. If `row_to_skip` is zero, the statement will work like it doesn’t have the `OFFSET` clause.

Because a table may store rows in an unspecified order, when you use the `LIMIT` clause, you should always use the `ORDER BY` clause to control the row order. If you don’t use the `ORDER BY` clause, you may get a result set with the unspecified order of rows.

### PostgreSQL LIMIT examples

Let's take some examples of using the PostgreSQL `LIMIT` clause. We will use the `film` table in the sample database for the demonstration.

#### 1) Using PostgreSQL LIMIT to constrain the number of returned rows example

This examples uses the `LIMIT` clause to get the first five films sorted by `film_id`:

```sql
SELECT
	film_id,
	title,
	release_year
FROM
	film
ORDER BY
	film_id
LIMIT 5;
```

#### 2) Using PostgreSQL LIMIT with OFFSET example

```sql
SELECT
	film_id,
	title,
	release_year
FROM
	film
ORDER BY
	film_id
LIMIT 4 OFFSET 3;
```

#### 3) Using PostgreSQL LIMIT OFFSET to get top / bottom N rows

Typically, you often use the `LIMIT` clause to select rows with the highest or lowest values from a table.

For example, to get the top 10 most expensive films in terms of rental, you sort films by the rentel rate in descending order and use the `LIMIT` clause to get the first 10 films. The following query illustrates the idea:

```sql
SELECT
	film_id,
	title,
	rental_rate
FROM
	film
ORDER BY
	rental_rate DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

The result of the queyr is as follows:
