### Copying Data to/from File

You can also have used `COPY` to load large amounts of data from flat-text files. This is usually faster because the `COPY` command is optimized for this application while allowing less flexibility than `INSERT`:


You can copy data to file, using COPY command.

```sql
test=# COPY weather TO '/var/lib/postgresql/weather.txt';
COPY 3
psql=# 
```

In above example we copied data *weather.txt* file. For this operation to be successful, file should exist.

And to copy data from the file:

```sql
test=# COPY weather FROM '/var/lib/postgresql/weather.txt';
```
