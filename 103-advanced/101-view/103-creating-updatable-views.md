# Creating PostgreSQL Updatable Views

- [<<< Drop Views](102-drop-views.md) | [Materialized Views >>>](104-materialized-view.md)

----------


A PostgreSQL view is updatable when it meets the following conditions:


- The defining query of the view must have exactly one entry in the `FROM` clause, which can be a table or another updatable view.
- The defining query must not contain one of the following clauses at the top level: `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`, `DISTINCT`, `WITH`, `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.
- The selection list must not contain any `window function` , any `set-returning function`, or any `aggregate function` such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.

An updatable view may contain both updatable and non-updatable columns. If you try to insert or update a non-updatable column, PostgreSQL will raise an error.


When you execute an update operation such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`, PosgreSQL will convert this statement into the corresponding statement of the underlying table.

In case you have a `WHERE` condition in the defining query of a view, you still can update or delete the rows that are not visible through the view. However, if you want to avoid this, you can use `CHECK OPTION` when you define the view.

When you perform update operations, you must have corresponding privilege on the view, but you donâ€™t need to have privilege on the underlying table. However, view owners must have the relevant privilege of the underlying table.


### PostgreSQL updatable views example

First, create a new updatable view name `usa_cities` using `CREATE VIEW` statement. This view contains all cities in the `city` table locating in the USA whose country id is 103.

```sql
CREATE VIEW usa_cities AS SELECT
	city,
	country_id
FROM
	city
WHERE
	country_id = 103;
```

Next, check the data in the `use_cities` view by executing the following `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
	usa_cities;
```

Then, insert a new city to the `city` table through the `use_cities` view using the following `INSERT` statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO usa_cities (city, country_id)
VALUES('San Jose', 103);
```

After that, check the contents of the `city` table:

```sql
SELECT
	city,
	country_id
FROM
	city
WHERE
	country_id = 103
ORDER BY
	last_update DESC;
```

We have a newly entry added to the city table.

Finally, delete the entry that has been added through the `use_cities` view.

```sql
DELETE
FROM
	usa_cities
WHERE
	city = 'San Jose';
```

The entry has been deleted from the `city` table through the `use_cities` view.
